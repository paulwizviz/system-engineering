# Overview

Welcome to my collection of projects that I have created and references to projects created by others to illustrate system engineering principles.

## Topics covered

* Algorithm and performance analysis
* Container technologies
* Databases
* Event driven technologies
* Summary use cases

## Algorithm and performance analysis

* [Go Algorithm and data models](https://github.com/paulwizviz/go-algo) a collection of Go based implementation of algorithms and data models
* [Performance measurement](https://github.com/paulwizviz/compute-performance.git) discuss technique to measure performance

## Container technologies

* [Learn Docker](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-docker.git))
* [Learn Kubernetes](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-k8s.git)

## Databases

Educational materials:

* [7 database paradigm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Z7fbCLSTw)

Working examples created by me:

* [CockroachDB](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-cockroachdb)
* [MongoDB](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-mongodb)
* [RedisDB](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-redis)
* [Key Value DB](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-keyvaluedb)
* [SQL Databases](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-sql)

## Event driven architecture

Please refer to [learn-mqtt](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-mqtt) for my illustration of MQTT based event driven system.

## Summary use cases

Currently under development are a collection of uses cases, combining the abovementioned core technologies.
