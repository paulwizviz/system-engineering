# Overview

Welcome to my collection of projects that I have created and references to projects created by others to illustrate system engineering principles.

## Topics covered

* Algorithm design and implementation
* Container technologies
* Databases
* Event driven technologies
* Summary use cases

## Algorithm design and implementation

Please refer to [go-algo](https://github.com/paulwizviz/go-algo) for illustrations of my Go based implementation of algorithms and data models.

## Container technologies

Please refer to [learn-container](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-container) where I illustrate feaures of container and container orchestration (docker-compose, kubernetes, etc) through use cases.

## Databases

Please refer to [learn-db](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-db) where I illustrate features of different database technologies through use cases.

## Event driven technologies

Please refer to [learn-mqtt](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-mqtt) for my illustration of MQTT based event driven system.

## Summary use cases

Currently under development are a collection of uses cases, combining the abovementioned core technologies.
