# Overview

My projects discussing topics related to system engineering that I encountered and worked on over my career.

## Algorithm and performance analysis

* [Go Algorithm and data models](https://github.com/paulwizviz/go-algo)
* [Performance measurement](https://github.com/paulwizviz/compute-performance.git)

## Application Programming Interface (API) design

<u>Two general's problem</u>

The two general's problem is an thought experiment to illustrate problems encountered when you have two systems communicating with each other.

<u>Messaging protocols</u>

* [GraphQL](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-graphql)
* [GRPC and Protobuf](https://github.com/paulwizviz/protobuf-lib-template)
* [JSON-RPC](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-jsonrpc.git)
* OAuth
* [REST](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-rest)

## Cloud

* [Learn Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-gcp)
* [Learn Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-aws)
* Digital ocean

## Container technologies

A container technology is a lightweight, executable unit of software that packs up application code and dependencies such as binary code, libraries, and configuration files for easy deployment across different computing environments[1](https://www.solarwinds.com/resources/it-glossary/container).

* [General container](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-container) - This cover technologies that is not based on Docker technologies and alternative approach to packaging applications into containers.
* [Docker](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-docker.git)
* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-k8s.git)

## Distributed and decentralized systems

Technically, a decentralised system is a type of distributed system. They have similar characteristics:

1. Computation are distributed across multiple nodes.
1. They are susceptable to Byzantine faults.

The differences between a distributed and a decentralised system are:

1. Distributed systems have a degree of centralised oversight, so Byzantine faults are largely mitigated.
1. Decentralised systems have nodes that are independently managed and are highly subsceptable to Byzantine faults. 

<u>Distributed system architectural pattern</u>

* [Top 7 Most-Used Distributed System Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH4qjmP2KEE)
* Please refer to the section named "Application Programming Interface (API) design" for detailed references
* [Microservices architectural pattern](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-microservices)

<u>Decentralized systems</u>

This type of architectural system is related blockchain. Please refer to [My Blockchain](https://github.com/paulwizviz/my-blockchain).


## Databases

* [CockroachDB](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-cockroachdb)
* [MongoDB](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-mongodb)
* [RedisDB](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-redis)
* [Key Value DB](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-keyvaluedb)
* [SQL Databases](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-sql)

## Event driven technologies

Concepts

* [The Many Meanings of Event-Driven Architecture by Martin Fowler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0)
* [Creating event-driven microservices: the why, how and what by Andrew Schofield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksRCq0BJef8)
