# Overview

My projects discussing topics related to system engineering that I encountered and worked on over my career.

## Algorithm and performance analysis

* [Go Algorithm and data models](https://github.com/paulwizviz/go-algo)
* [Performance measurement](https://github.com/paulwizviz/compute-performance.git)

## Application Programming Interface (API) design

* [GraphQL](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-graphql)
* [GRPC and Protobuf](https://github.com/paulwizviz/protobuf-lib-template)
* [JSON-RPC](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-jsonrpc.git)
* OAuth
* [REST](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-rest)

## Cloud

* [Learn Google Cloud Platform](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-gcp)
* [Learn Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-aws)
* Digital ocean

## Container technologies

A container technology is a lightweight, executable unit of software that packs up application code and dependencies such as binary code, libraries, and configuration files for easy deployment across different computing environments[1](https://www.solarwinds.com/resources/it-glossary/container).

* [General container](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-container) - This cover technologies that is not based on Docker technologies and alternative approach to packaging applications into containers.
* [Docker](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-docker.git)
* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-k8s.git)

## Distributed system

This section was supposed to provide access to knowledge about distributed system design. However, I have lumped this topic under "blockchain". Please refer to [My Blockchain](https://github.com/paulwizviz/my-blockchain).

The decision to lump discussion about distributed system and "blockchain" are:

* There are some similarities between these two architectural paradigms;
* Purely logistics so I can easily contrasts between the two paradigms.

It is necessary to emphasise that traditional concept of "distributed" system is different from "decentralised" systems. The differences are not just in terms of vocabularies but also substance, albeit highly nuanced.

## Databases

* [CockroachDB](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-cockroachdb)
* [MongoDB](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-mongodb)
* [RedisDB](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-redis)
* [Key Value DB](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-keyvaluedb)
* [SQL Databases](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-sql)

## Event driven technologies

Concepts

* [The Many Meanings of Event-Driven Architecture by Martin Fowler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STKCRSUsyP0)
* [Creating event-driven microservices: the why, how and what by Andrew Schofield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksRCq0BJef8)


Topics

Please refers to the following for detail descriptions:

* [MQTT](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-mqtt)
* [Kafka](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-kafka)

## Networking

The topics in this section are categorised to reflect the OSI model:

Concepts

* [What is OSI Model | Real World Examples ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y6FtKsg6J4)

## Security

* [Cryptography](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-crypto)
* [Security Frameworks](https://github.com/paulwizviz/learn-security)

## Summary Examples

The following are working examples demonstrating the use of techniques and technologies mentioned above. 

* [Go web](https://github.com/paulwizviz/go-web) - An example demonstrating an approach to combine ReactJS and Go app to produce native and container apps.
* [Lottery stats](https://github.com/paulwizviz/lotterystat) - An example demonstraing an end-to-end solution from backend to frontend coupled with the application of agile methodology
