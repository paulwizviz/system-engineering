## Overview

MQTT stands for MQ Telemetry Transport. The protocol is a set of rules that defines how IoT devices can publish and subscribe to data over the Internet. MQTT is used for messaging and data exchange between IoT and industrial IoT (IIoT) devices, such as embedded devices, sensors, industrial PLCs, etc. The protocol is event driven and connects devices using the publish /subscribe (Pub/Sub) pattern. The sender (Publisher) and the receiver (Subscriber) communicate via Topics and are decoupled from each other. The connection between them is handled by the MQTT broker. The MQTT broker filters all incoming messages and distributes them correctly to the Subscribers. ([source](https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt/))
