# Internet Protocol

Internet Protocol (IP) is a connection free protocol that is an integral part of the Internet protocol suite (a collection of around 500 network protocols) and is responsible for the addressing and fragmentation of data packets in digital networks. Together with the transport layer TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), IP makes up the basis of the internet (source [What is Internet Protocol (IP)?](#references)).

## IP Addressing Version 4

There are three classes:

* Class C 
* Class B 
* Class A

Class C has IP address range (192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255) with /24 subnet mask and representing 255 IP address
Class B has IP address range (172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255) with /16 subnet mask and representing 65,000 IP address
Class A has IP address range (10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255) with /8 subnet mask and representing 16 million address
