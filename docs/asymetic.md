# Asymmetric Cryptography

Asymmetric cryptography, also know as public key cryptography, uses a pair of keys: private and public for encryption and decryption. In this section we discuss asymmetric keys.

## Elliptic Curve

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a key-based technique for encrypting data. ECC focuses on pairs of public and private keys for decryption and encryption (see [here](https://avinetworks.com/glossary/elliptic-curve-cryptography/)).

## Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)

There are two broad components when it comes to RSA cryptography, they are: 

* Key Generation for encrypting and decrypting the data to be exchanged.
* Encryption/Decryption Function.
