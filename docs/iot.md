# Internet of Things (IoTs)

This section discuss all things related to IoT.

## Components

The key components are:

### Hardware:
* **Sensors:** These devices collect data from the environment, such as temperature, pressure, light, and motion.
* **Actuators:** These devices can control physical systems, such as turning on and off lights, opening and closing valves, and moving motors.
* **Microcontrollers:** These small computers are used to process data from sensors and control actuators.
* **Connectivity hardware:** This includes devices such as Wi-Fi routers, Bluetooth chips, and cellular modems, which allow IoT devices to communicate with each other and with the internet.

### Protocols
* Connectivity Protocols (How devices connect to the network):
    * **Wi-Fi**: A widely used wireless technology for connecting devices to a local network and the internet. It's common in homes and offices.
    * **Bluetooth/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**: Short-range wireless technology often used for connecting personal devices like wearables and smartphones to IoT devices. BLE is designed for low power consumption.
    * **Zigbee:** A low-power, low-data rate wireless protocol ideal for mesh networks in home automation and industrial control.
    * **Z-Wave:** Another popular mesh network protocol primarily used for home automation.
    * **Cellular (3G, 4G, 5G, LTE-M, NB-IoT):** These technologies enable IoT devices to connect directly to cellular networks, useful for devices that need wider coverage.
    * **LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network):** Designed for long-range communication with low power consumption, suitable for applications like smart agriculture and environmental monitoring.
    * **Sigfox:** Another long-range, low-power wide-area network technology.
* Data Protocols (How devices exchange data):
    * **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport):** A lightweight messaging protocol ideal for constrained devices and unreliable networks. It's widely used in IoT for its efficiency and publish/subscribe mechanism.
    * **CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol):** A web transfer protocol designed for low-power devices and lossy networks. It's similar to HTTP but optimized for IoT.
    * **AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol):** A robust messaging protocol that ensures reliable message delivery. It's often used in industrial IoT applications.
    * **HTTP/HTTPS:** The foundation of the web, also used in IoT for devices that need to communicate with web services.
    * **WebSockets:** Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between devices and servers.
    * **JetStream:** A streaming data protocol built into the NATS server, designed for high-throughput, persistent, and reliable delivery of data streams. It features built in flow control, and ordered delivery. Well suited for high volume telemetry data, and use cases that require data durability.
* Other Important Protocols:
    * **Modbus:** An industrial protocol used for communication with programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and other industrial equipment.
    OPC UA (OLE for Process Control Unified Architecture): Another industrial protocol for data exchange and communication in automation systems.
    * **DDS (Data Distribution Service):** A high-performance protocol for real-time data distribution, often used in applications like autonomous vehicles and robotics.

| Feature | MQTT | CoAP | AMQP | HTTP/HTTPS | WebSockets |JetStream |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Focus** | Constrained devices | Constrained devices | Reliable messaging | Web interaction | Real-time comms | Streaming data |
| **Model** | Publish/Subscribe | Request/Response | Message Queuing | Request/Response | Bidirectional | Publish/Subscribe |
| **Overhead** | Low | Low | High | High | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Reliability** | Variable (QoS) | Lower (UDP) | High | Variable (TCP) | Reliable (TCP) | High (Persistence) |
| **Complexity** | Low | Low | High | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |
| **Use Cases**	| Sensors, M2M | Smart devices | Industrial, finance |	Web-connected devices | Real-time apps | High-volume IoT, telemetry, analytics |
| **Key Strengths** | Lightweight, efficient | Lightweight, UDP-based	Guaranteed delivery | Widely understood, tools | Real-time, bi-directional | High throughput, persistence, flow control |
| **Key Weaknesses** | Not always guaranteed delivery | UDP, less reliable than TCP | Complex, resource intensive |	Resource-intensive | More complex than HTTP for simple data | Requires NATS server |

Choosing the right protocol depends on several factors:
    * **Range:** How far apart are the devices?
    * **Bandwidth:** How much data needs to be transmitted?
    * **Power consumption:** How much power do the devices use?
    * **Security:** How important is data security?
    * **Cost:** How much does it cost to implement the protocol?
