# Symetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption key management solution where only one key (a secret key) is used to both encrypt and decrypt electronic data (see [What is symmetric encryption?](https://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/symmetric-key-encryption-why-where-and-how-its-used-in-banking)).

## Advanced Eyncryption Standard (AES)

Here are the key points from the [Advanced Eyncryption Standard](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advanced-encryption-standard-aes/):

* AES is a block cipher.
* The key size can be 128/192/256 bits.
* Encrypts data in blocks of 128 bits each. That means it takes 128 bits as input and outputs 128 bits of encrypted cipher text as output.
* AES performs operations on bytes of data rather than in bits.
