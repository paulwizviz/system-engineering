# GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) that gives API clients exactly the data they requested. As an alternative to REST, GraphQL allows developers to make requests to fetch data from multiple data sources with a single API call. (Source: [GraphQL](https://www.solo.io/topics/graphql))
