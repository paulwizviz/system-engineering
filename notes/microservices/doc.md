# Microservices

Microservices are an architectural style where a large application is broken down into a suite of small, independent services that communicate with each other through well-defined APIs. Each service is built around a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

Microservices are based on request/response communication pattern.

## Key Characteristics

* **Single Responsibility**: Each service focuses on doing one thing.
* **Independent Deployability**: Services can be deployed and updated without affecting other parts of the application.
* **Decentralisd Governance**: Teams can implement specific services using technologies they find appropriate.
* **Loosely Coupled**: Services communicate through APIs, minimizing dependencies on each other's internal workings.
* **Autonomous**: Each service can be developed, deployed, operated, and scaled independently.
* **Designed for Business Capabilities**: Services are organized around business functions.
